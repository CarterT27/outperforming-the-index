# Outperforming The Index - Investment Analysis Dashboard

A static webpage prototype that explores the reality of beating market returns through interactive data visualizations. This project demonstrates the narrative of comparing individual stock performance (using NVIDIA as an example) against dollar cost averaging in the S&P 500.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This prototype tells a compelling data story:

1. **NVIDIA Success Story**: Shows NVIDIA's dramatic stock price appreciation over time with animated visualizations
2. **Reality Check**: Demonstrates how rare such performance is through a histogram of S&P 500 returns distribution
3. **DCA Alternative**: Compares dollar cost averaging strategies between NVIDIA and S&P 500
4. **Strategy Builder**: Interactive tool for users to test their own investment strategies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: View the Static Prototype

Simply open `index.html` in your browser to view the complete prototype. All functionality is implemented using client-side JavaScript with D3.js.

### Option 2: Serve Locally (Recommended)

For best results, serve the files through a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have live-server installed)
npx live-server

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Responsive Sizing**: Fluid typography scales with viewport
- **Weight Hierarchy**: 300-700 weight range for proper hierarchy

## 📱 Responsive Design

The prototype is fully responsive with breakpoints at:
- **Desktop**: 1200px+ (Full layout)
- **Tablet**: 768px-1199px (Adapted layout)
- **Mobile**: <768px (Stacked layout)

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding Real Data

To integrate with your actual data files:

1. **Load Data**: Modify `d3-charts.js` to load from your `.parquet` files using a library like [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/js/)
2. **Update Functions**: Replace the sample data generation functions with real data processing
3. **Connect Backend**: Add API endpoints to serve processed data

### Extending Charts

The D3.js implementation is modular and can be extended:

```javascript
// Add new chart type
function createCustomChart(containerId, data, options) {
    // D3.js implementation
}

// Register with main script
window.renderCustomChart = createCustomChart;
```

### Styling Modifications

The CSS uses custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #your-brand-color;
    --font-family: 'Your-Font', sans-serif;
}
```

## 📈 Data Sources

The prototype currently uses:
- **Sample Data**: Generated simulated data for demonstration
- **Existing Files**: Your S&P 500 analysis from `*.parquet` files
- **Static Images**: Visualization exports in `assets/`

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with accessibility considerations
- **CSS3**: Modern features including Grid, Flexbox, and Custom Properties
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern syntax with modules and async/await
- **D3.js v7**: Latest version for data visualization
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Community leaderboard
- [ ] Advanced portfolio optimization

## 🎯 Key Messages

The prototype effectively communicates:

1. **Survivorship Bias**: NVIDIA's success is exceptional, not typical
2. **Risk vs. Return**: High returns come with high volatility
3. **DCA Benefits**: Systematic investing reduces timing risk
4. **Diversification**: Broad market exposure vs. individual stock picking
